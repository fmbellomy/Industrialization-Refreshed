# Industrialization: Refreshed

A port of [GregTech: Refreshed](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/gregtech-refreshed) for [Modern Industrialization](a).

Requires the [Athena](https://modrinth.com/mod/athena-ctm) mod to add CTM to blocks.  

(WARNING: DESIGNED WITH FABRIC 1.20.1 IN MIND.)

### To-Do:

1. Retexture motors and pumps.
2. Colour the Wrench texture.
3. Create new Pipe Machine Casing textures (compatible with CTM)
4. Edit Capacitor texture from GTR to fit MI resource requirements.
5. Retexture all circuit boards, circuits, and circuit components.
6. Retexture all crushed dusts to fit the GTR style.
7. Retexture all parts (gears, cogs, plates, ingots etc.) to match GTR style.
8. Retexture misc. items (e.g., pipe config card, wood pulp, rubber sheet)
9. Retexture barrels, tanks, crates, and energy storage units.
10. Edit item and fluid IO ports.
11. Retexture iridium machine casings.
12. Retexture reactor casings.
13. Edit Blastproof Casing to look, well, more blast-proof.
14. Edit the pipe / cable textures and models.
15. Get emissive textures working. (i.e., via Continuity)

### Install instructions:
